#WEB OPTIMIZER
##Introduction
This is a system for optimizing websites.  It will primarily optimize scripts, so if your website is mostly HTML and CSS, it won't help you very much.

In the "serv" folder there is the contents of a web application which serves this function.  It can be put on any server (I recommend XAMPP or another localhost server, but really anything works) and then you can get right to speeding up your website!
##How to set up:

- Make sure that your server supports PHP and HTACCESS.
- Download the contents of the "serv" folder to your server.
- In a web browser, visit "configure.php" to finish setting everything up.
- If you decide to move the files to a different folder, delete "configured.txt" and visit "configure.php" again.
